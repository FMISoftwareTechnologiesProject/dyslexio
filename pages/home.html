        Welcome to Dyslexio  project!<br><br>

        Here you will find a group of different games that will help in improving your learning skills. These games are created with the purpose of helping children with phonetic awareness problems (Dyslexia). They help in improving of these abilities: reading fluently, blend and spilt syllables use the right punctuation signs, improving visual memory; distinguish different letters, words. To learn more about Dyslexia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia" target="_blank"> click here</a>.<br><br>

        You can select different type of games from the list above and start playing them. Each game will start at a medium level of difficulty and based on your performance it will adapt in a higher or a lower one. Non visual games are recommended for children over 6 years old. 
        Voice instructions will be present at each game and will direct (advice) you how to play these games. Also depending of the game there will be given different opportunities to hear text written on the game.<br><br>
